This Monte Carlo Code is written in the school of ITAP, Turun√ß.
Despite many codes are tailored for the purpose, this code is intended to have a jobpacket - machine approach to monte carlo simulations, with the ability to simulate as many systems as possible.

RIGHT NOW THE CODE IS FAR FROM BEING USABLE.
IN THIS STAGE, IT IS STILL IN THE BRAINSTORMING PHASE, WITH MANY CLASSES AND FUNCTIONS SCATTERED AROUND.
